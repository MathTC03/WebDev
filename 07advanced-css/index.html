            <h1>Wool Prep</h1>
            
            <p>Say you've shorn a sheep or a llama, and have a bunch of wool that you want to turn into a blanket or something. How would you go about that?</p>
            
            <figure class="wrapped">
                <img src="images/dirty-wool.jpg" alt="Dirty Wool" width="279" height="181">
                <figcaption>Dirty Wool</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <h2>Cleaning</h2>
            
            <p>The wool is <strong>very dirty</strong> and filled with oil and dirt when it is shorn. It must be cleaned to be put to proper use.<br>
            The steps are as follows:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Pick out any big clumps of grime or dirt to make life easier.</li>
                <li>Let the wool sit in hot water, either in a bucket or some other container.</li>
                <li>Take the wool out of the water for a few hours, clean out the bucket, and repeat #3 until the water is relatively clean after.</li>
                <li>Let the wool dry for about a day.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The wool should now be clean enough. Any extra dirt should come out during other processes.</p>
            
            <h2>Dyeing</h2>
            
            <p>If you want colorful yarn, this is the part where you would want to dye the wool. Otherwise, this is optional.<br>
            Simply, boil the wool in water mixed with whichever dye you would want to use. This will change the color of the wool so that it is not white anymore. After doing this, let it dry.</p>
            
            <h2>Carding and Combing</h2>
            
            <p>The wool will be very messy and annoying to spin. To make the wool nice to use, these processes adjust the fibers to make a much nicer quality material. these processes do different things, so depending on the quality of the fabric/yarn desired, a different one should be done.</p>
            
            <dl>
                <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding" target="_blank">Carding</a></dt>
                <dd>This make the wool fluffy. It is usually done with a carding paddle, though there are mechanisms to automate the process. Wool is spread onto one paddle and then transferred to the other paddle by brushing the paddles together.</dd>
                <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combing" target="_blank">Combing</a></dt>
                <dd>This makes the fiber straight, usually for worstened wool. Wool is fed through two combs, which are then pulled apart.</dd>
                <dt>Woollen vs. Worsted</dt>
                <dd>Woollen is very fluffy and make the yarn comfortable. Worsted makes the yarn very durable</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <p>Now the wool should be ready for spinning.</p>
